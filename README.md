### Installation Instructions:

This will conflict with the original OopsAllLalafells Dalamud plugin, so remove that first if it's installed.

To install, navigate to your XIVLauncher local plugins folder, located at `AppData/Roaming/XIVLauncher/devPlugins`. Extract the ZIP file here. The result should look like `.../devPlugins/OopsAllLalafells/1.1.0.0/...`. Launch FFXIV via XIVLauncher and you should see the plugin installed. (Ignore the warning about removing it from `devPlugins`.)

### Usage Instructions:

Use this just like you would use the original version of the plugin. Enabling experimental features and selecting the option to change others' races will allow you to control which races to use. The "New Race" option is the same as the "Race" option in the original plugin - this sets the race you want others to appear as. The "Original Race" option is new - set this to "Any" to get the old behavior and change the appearance of all other characters, or set it to a specific race to change only the appearance of that race.
